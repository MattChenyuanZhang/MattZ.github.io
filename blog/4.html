                I used to playing games crazily from day to night, trying different roles such as clinical intern, background actor, delivery person
                and video game live streamer. I enjoy them, especially being a video game live streamer. I was immersed in
                the joy of beating others by my strategy and witness, and never got tired of it. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                But I also love science, especially math. I always get lost in how boundless imagination science could be, and when
                I daydream, the scene always on the top of my head is when Steve Jobs released the new version of iphone, and sometimes about ironman.
                There has been times that I thought technology and science didn't change a lot, but since 2022 ChatGPT came into the world, I finally 
                realized that the world is changing, or may will be exponantially changing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also got tired of playing games, I still love games, but I got a series of health issues as a result of endless playing, and most importantly
                I thought I can't live like this out of my life. I can do more meaningful things than games, and I can make the world a better
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now I am coming, and I am a computer science student, and let's see what will happen.
