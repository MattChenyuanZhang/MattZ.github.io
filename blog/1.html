                The most important technology in this century is AI. And after
                trying some stuff in computer science, I believe it's the right
                field for me and I want to do more research about AI. I am very
                interested in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As AI develops rapidly, people will tend to worry about losing
                jobs since most tasks that have a clear goal and logic to do thus 
                can be automated. It's right, but I believe we will find the 
                solutions and there will be even more new forms of jobs coming.
                Here are my thoughts.
            </p>
            <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
            <p>
                I used to be a video game live streamer, and I realized it's
                the tendency that there will more and more people working in
                virtual entertainment field(whether in gaming or other fields)
                because of unprecedented productivity boost. The thing that makes
                me believe in this is (1). Most video games, just like other real
                world sports, is a zero-sum game, theoratically it has no conflict
                with productivity(which will be largely replaced with AI combined
                machine) (2). In video games, human beings really matters, we 
                naturally don't want to see 2 robots competing with each other, 
                instead we will cheer for 2 imperfect human beings try their best
                 by their strategies and talents to win the game. (3). Virtual 
                reality is a blue sea field, what ever you can imagine, you can 
                put into it, which will finally lead to a much more abundant world
                than the physical world we currently live.
            </p>
            <h3>AI alignment</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, the future will be much better, but AI needs alignment,
                we need to make sure AI contribute to the world correctly, and 
                the main part of the world is still lead by human. I don't dig
                this field deep enough, but I believe the main task of AI is to
                improve the imperfect part of our world, for example, providing
                accessible education resources, mitigating and controlling
                global warming, curing diseases and so on, meanwhile, we can
                have more time to do the things we are interested in and the
                main part of our lives, is still surrounded by people. This is
                the best picture I can think of, and I think we denfintely can
                achieve that by everyone's effort.
