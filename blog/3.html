                <h1>Evidence of people still need to learn coding</h1>

                Some times it's easily be overwhelmed that why we should learn coding since AI can generate code in a second easily
                while human need to take hours to write. 
            </p>
            <p>An easy evidence is to just look at the top schools in computer science, if they
                still teach coding hand by hand, then you can probably be confident that we still need to learn how to code in every detail
                otherwise all computer science students in the world learn it just for killing the time(of course, 
                top schools can also be wrong but the chance is not that big).
