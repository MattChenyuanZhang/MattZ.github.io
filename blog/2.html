                1. Think beyond the rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. If you are hesitate about doing something, take some time to weigh the pros and consï¼Œthink what will happen in both doing or not doing this thing.
                "Doing something" can mean attend an event or get a work experience or just simply clicking intp a link in a website(Yes, that's where I
                found time is most easily been wasted)
                The answer will usually be yes for people who are ambitious(which means they have big goals) and have long-term goal(also means they have big goals).
